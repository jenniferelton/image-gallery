Lab: Image Gallery
===

Pick a topic 

* :baseball: baseball  
* :surfer: surfing  
* :cat2: kittens  
* :guitar: guitars 
* :pizza: pizza 
* (etc.)

and create a themed image gallery app based on today's lecture.

## Requirements
* Make it responsive, using a combination of CSS Grid and Flexbox.
* Follow the Webpack component and router architecture we've used on other labs.
* Choose appropriate UI and navigational patterns based on your app's functionality and goals.
* Your app should create, update, remove image data using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).
* [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/responsive_images) should be used to serve appropriate responsive images.
* Sketch your responsive layout **and** app component structure before developing.

See [today's classwork](https://github.com/acl-devsign-winter-2018/classwork/tree/master/14-apps) for notes on working with Firebase and creating App template.

Note that the sketch process doesn't have to end once development begins. If you get stuck, sketch or whiteboard until the answer is clear.
